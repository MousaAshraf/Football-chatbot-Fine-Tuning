- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Removes noise, stopwords, and tokenizes questions and answers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes question/answer lengths and most common words using histograms and word clouds.
- **Fine-Tuning:** Uses **LoRA** to adapt the pre-trained Flan-T5-base model efficiently, reducing GPU memory usage.
- **Inference:** Few-shot prompt-based answering for football trivia.
- **Web App:** Interactive chatbot via Streamlit.
- **Deployment:** Accessible online using **ngrok**.
